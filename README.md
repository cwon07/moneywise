# 💰 MoneyWise

MoneyWise is a visual budgeting tool designed to help individuals and families easily plan monthly expenses and understand spending habits. It combines simple UI with clear visualizations to make budgeting approachable — even for users with little financial experience.

## 📝 Overview
Most budgeting apps are cluttered or overly technical. MoneyWise takes a clean, modern approach: drag-and-drop simplicity, real-time pie charts, and intuitive labels to help users build a budget they can actually stick to.

## 🚀 Features
- Drag-and-drop interface for organizing expenses  
- Real-time pie chart visualization of monthly budget  
- Editable labels, tooltips, and totals
